            Writing in your diary helps you gain the full benefits of using GreenTouch. It supports deeper self-awareness and allows you to reflect on and track your thoughts and feelings over time.

            Your diary entries are personal and only visible to you. They won&apos;t be shared with others, though the research team will access them for analysis in anonymous, confidential form. You&apos;ll receive reflective prompts during sessions but are also free to record any thoughts, emotions, or insightsâ€”especially from time spent in nature.
